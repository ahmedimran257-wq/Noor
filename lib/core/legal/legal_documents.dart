By creating an account, accessing the Service or purchasing a subscription, you accept these Terms and the Privacy Policy, Privacy Rights and Grievance Policy, Community Guidelines, Refund Policy, Data Deletion Policy, Verification Policy, Photo Moderation Policy and Guardian/Wali Policy.

Silarah is intended for adults seeking a genuine matrimonial introduction. It is not an escort, casual-dating, employment, immigration, fundraising or financial-services platform.

You are responsible for safeguarding authentication codes and devices and for activity under your account. Do not create an account for another adult without their knowledge and authority. Notify support@silarah.com promptly if you suspect unauthorized access. We may require reverification when information changes or safety risk is detected.',

Compatibility explanations may omit criteria that either member did not specify and do not reveal another member’s private preference values. Limits on interests, messages, boosts and other features may vary by plan, gender-based product rules, safety state and region, and are displayed in the app before use or purchase. A match or accepted interest does not establish endorsement, identity certainty, compatibility or consent to off-platform contact. Respect blocks, withdrawals and requests to stop communicating.',

A badge is not a guarantee that every statement is true or that a member is safe. Guardian mode is optional product functionality and is not legal advice or a determination that a particular wali arrangement is valid under religious or civil law. The separate Verification and Guardian/Wali Policies apply.',

Premium features may include explainable compatibility insights, private shortlist organization and Incognito Discovery. Incognito limits appearance in general discovery and search while it is enabled and Premium remains active; it does not hide you from people with whom you already interacted, matched, shared photo access or established a guardian relationship. Google Play subscriptions renew automatically at the price and frequency displayed by Google Play until cancelled there. Use the in-app Manage Subscription link or Google Play Subscription Center before the renewal date shown in Google Play. Removing the app, pausing a profile or deleting a Silarah account does not cancel store billing. Cancellation stops future renewal and ordinarily leaves access until the paid period ends; it does not automatically refund the current period. Refund eligibility is governed by applicable consumer law, Google Play’s rules and our Refund Policy. Premium improves access to stated features but never guarantees an interest, match, response, meeting or marriage.',

A deletion request enters a 30-day recovery period and is then permanently processed, subject to limited lawful retention described in the Data Deletion and Privacy Policies.

We do not arrange or guarantee a meeting, relationship or marriage; verify every claim; control member conduct off-platform; or promise uninterrupted or error-free operation. Always use independent judgment, protect financial and identity information, involve trusted people where appropriate, meet safely and report concerns. Nothing in these Terms excludes warranties or rights that cannot lawfully be excluded.',

Our aggregate liability arising from the Service will not exceed the greater of the amount you paid Silarah in the 12 months before the event or the minimum amount required by applicable law. These limits do not apply to fraud, wilful misconduct, death or personal injury caused by negligence, or any liability that law does not permit us to limit.',

Precise device location is requested only for location-based discovery and can be denied; city-based discovery remains available.',

        '4. Sensitive and verification data',
        'Religious beliefs, temporary verification captures and some matrimonial information may be sensitive under applicable law. We use religious information for compatibility only with explicit consent where required. The optional photo check creates three temporary guided captures for an authorized human to compare with the current profile photo. We do not create facial embeddings or templates, perform government-ID matching, estimate age from a face, or use these captures for advertising.',

Compatibility uses stated profile and preference fields and returns only a criterion-level explanation, not another member’s raw preferences. Depending on your location, we rely on performance of our contract, consent (including explicit consent for sensitive data), legitimate interests in operating and protecting the Service, and legal obligations. You may withdraw consent prospectively, although some features may then be unavailable.',

        'Profile fields you choose to publish are visible to eligible registered members according to discovery and privacy settings. Incognito removes a profile from general discovery and name/city search while the setting is effective, but it cannot make prior interactions anonymous: people with an existing interest, match, permitted photo-access relationship or connected guardian relationship may continue to access the profile as needed for that relationship. Photos follow your selected mode: public, visible after mutual interest, or request-to-view. Private shortlist categories, notes and reminders are visible only to their author and are never shown to the saved member or that member’s guardian. Messages are visible to conversation participants and may be visible to a properly linked guardian where guardian chat mirroring is enabled. Reports disclose necessary content to authorized safety staff, not to the reported member except as needed for a fair process.',

These providers process data needed for their role under their own contractual and legal obligations. We may also disclose data at your direction, during a corporate transaction, to protect people and the Service, or when lawfully required. We do not sell personal data and do not run third-party behavioural advertising.',

Private shortlist metadata is deleted when its bookmark is removed or the account is deleted; a one-shot reminder is marked as sent and is not repeatedly queued. Incognito preference metadata is retained with the active account so the setting can be enforced consistently across devices. A requested account enters a 30-day recovery period before purge. Temporary photo-verification captures are deleted from active verification storage after review and no later than 48 hours after submission. We retain the decision, date, reviewer audit and deletion result without retaining the captures. Information and removed content that applicable intermediary rules require us to preserve may be retained for 180 days, or longer when a lawful order requires it. Reports, blocks, transaction records, consent records, security logs and backups may otherwise remain only for applicable limitation, tax, payment, abuse-prevention and legal periods, then be deleted or de-identified. Backup deletion completes through normal provider rotation. We periodically review retention and avoid keeping identifiable data merely because it may be useful.',

No online system is risk-free. Use a secure device, protect OTP codes and report suspected compromise promptly. We investigate suspected personal-data breaches, take proportionate containment and remediation steps, and notify affected people and the competent authority within the time and manner required by applicable law.',

In-app controls let you edit your profile, change photo visibility, pause discovery, manage notifications, block members, download a machine-readable ZIP archive and request deletion. Withdrawal must be as easy as giving consent, but processing already lawfully completed is not reversed. We may proportionately verify identity before completing a request.

Retained records are access-restricted, not used for discovery or marketing, and deleted or de-identified when the applicable purpose or legal period ends. Encrypted backups expire through normal rotation rather than being edited record by record.'),

For access, correction, export, restriction or deletion of a particular category, email privacy@silarah.com. We will explain if deletion would make a requested feature unavailable or if law permits us to refuse part of the request.'),

    sections: [
      LegalSection('1. Scope and request channels',
          'This Policy explains the rights-request and grievance process for Silarah members and people whose data may be processed by the Service. Signed-in members should use the account controls where available because authentication provides proportionate identity verification. You may also email privacy@silarah.com for access, correction, consent or deletion requests, grievance@silarah.com for formal complaints, and safety@silarah.com for urgent safety content. Never send passwords, OTP codes, payment credentials or identity documents by ordinary email.'),
      LegalSection('2. Downloading a portable copy',
          'Profile → Settings → Privacy → Download my data creates an authenticated ZIP archive immediately and opens the device save or share sheet. It includes a machine-readable JSON copy of account and profile data, current accessible profile photos, interests, matches, messages, settings, consent records, subscription events, notifications, guardian links, verification decisions, blocks and reports created by you. Repeated generation is briefly rate-limited to protect account data and control database cost.'),
      LegalSection('3. Export limits and assisted access',
          'The self-service archive excludes passwords, OTP codes, raw notification credentials, temporary verification captures, other members’ confidential reports, staff identities, privileged legal material and details that would undermine anti-abuse controls. Those exclusions do not automatically determine the result of a formal legal request. Email privacy@silarah.com if you require an omitted category, an explanation of processing, a summary of data, the identities or categories of processors, or an accessible alternative format. We may redact third-party data and apply lawful exceptions.'),
      LegalSection('4. Correction, erasure and withdrawal',
          'You can correct many profile fields and replace or remove photos in the app. You can pause discovery without deleting the account, or request account deletion in Settings. Consent may be withdrawn through the relevant control or privacy@silarah.com, and withdrawing it must be as easy as giving it. Withdrawal applies prospectively and may disable a feature that cannot operate without the data. Erasure may be limited where retention remains necessary for law, safety, fraud prevention, claims, payments or another permitted purpose.'),
      LegalSection('5. Identity verification and request tracking',
          'We verify a request using the signed-in session, the registered email or proportionate account facts. We do not ask for more data than reasonably needed and will provide a secure route if stronger verification is genuinely necessary. Include the account email, request type and relevant dates. We may ask you to identify the profile field, message, transaction or decision concerned. Duplicate or abusive automated requests may be consolidated without preventing a genuine legal right.'),
      LegalSection('6. Grievance timelines in India',
          'Formal grievances are acknowledged within 24 hours and ordinarily resolved within 7 days under the applicable Indian intermediary rules. Complaints concerning specified removal requests follow the legally shorter deadline, including 36 hours for qualifying unlawful-content complaints and 2 hours for qualifying intimate imagery, nudity, sexual impersonation or similar urgent material. These timelines do not guarantee a requested outcome and may change when amended law imposes a shorter period.'),
      LegalSection('7. Grievance information and evidence',
          'The grievance officer is Imran Ahmed. Send a concise description, account email, dates, relevant profile or conversation reference and the outcome requested to grievance@silarah.com. Do not forward suspected child sexual abuse material or non-consensual intimate imagery by email; identify where it appears so authorized staff can preserve and restrict it safely. We may acknowledge receipt, request necessary clarification, issue a reasoned outcome, preserve required evidence, restrict content or accounts, and notify an authority when law requires.'),
      LegalSection('8. Appeals and external remedies',
          'If you disagree with a grievance decision, reply with the original reference and explain the error. Where the Indian Grievance Appellate Committee has jurisdiction, an eligible appeal may be filed through its prescribed online mechanism within the legally applicable period, currently 30 days from receipt of the grievance officer’s decision. Privacy complaints may also be taken to the competent data-protection authority when its relevant powers and procedures are in force. Nothing here removes a non-waivable court, consumer or regulatory remedy.'),
      LegalSection('9. Security, records and changes',
          'Rights requests and grievance records are access-restricted and used to verify, investigate, respond, audit compliance, prevent abuse and meet legal duties. Required intermediary records and removed content may be preserved for 180 days or a longer period directed by a lawful order; other request records are retained only as needed for proof, security, limitation and legal obligations. Material changes to this process will be published with a new policy version and notified or presented for renewed consent where required.'),

      LegalSection('1. Purpose and types of check',
          'Silarah may offer profile-photo review, verified-email confirmation, verified-email Guardian connection and established-member indicators. These are separate trust signals. They do not establish legal identity and are not a comprehensive background check. Silarah does not collect phone numbers, government IDs or biometric templates for these checks.'),
      LegalSection('2. What we collect',
          'For the optional photo check, we process three temporary guided captures (look at camera, gentle smile and blink), the current primary profile photo, submission timestamps, decision status, reviewer notes and deletion audit. We do not request a government ID for this check and do not create or retain facial embeddings or templates.'),
      LegalSection('3. Automated and manual processing',
          'On-device face signals provide capture guidance only. Smile and blink detection may be bypassed through the accessibility fallback. Every submission is decided by an authorized human reviewer comparing the temporary captures with the current profile photo; an on-device score can never grant or reject the badge.'),
      LegalSection('4. Fair-use requirements',
          'Submit your own current, unaltered image. Normal glasses, hijab, niqab and culturally modest clothing are allowed. Do not use filters, screens, masks intended to deceive or another person. Poor lighting, multiple people, mismatch or suspected manipulation may require resubmission or rejection.'),
      LegalSection('5. Badge meaning and limitations',
          'A badge means only that the stated Silarah check passed at a point in time. It does not certify character, intentions, marital status, finances, criminal history, immigration status or safety, and it does not replace independent judgment. We may remove or repeat verification when material information changes or risk is detected.'),
      LegalSection('6. Access, security and retention',
          'Temporary captures are stored privately, shown only through short-lived staff previews, and are never displayed to members or guardians. They are deleted from active verification storage after review and no later than 48 hours after submission. The decision, timestamps, reviewer audit and deletion result may remain for integrity, appeals and legal obligations without retaining the captures.'),
      LegalSection('7. Decision and appeal',
          'The app provides a reason or next step when possible. You may retry after correcting quality issues or appeal through safety@silarah.com. Include your account email and decision date, but do not email identity documents. Staff may request a new secure submission. Appeals do not guarantee approval.'),
      LegalSection('8. Regional availability and account confirmation',
          'The initial service launch is limited to India as shown in the app and Google Play listing. Accounts use verified email; Silarah does not collect or verify phone numbers. Women message mutual matches free. Men require active paid, referral or authorized testing Premium to send. Premium billing remains tied to the Google Play and Silarah account. Guardian invitations are one-time, expire after 7 days, are stored only as hashes and can be accepted only by the invited verified-email account.'),

      LegalSection('1. Scope',
          'This Policy applies to profile and gallery photos. It is separate from the optional profile-photo trust check. Passing automated photo moderation does not grant a trust badge, and a trust badge does not exempt a photo from these rules.'),
      LegalSection('2. What profile photos must show',
          'Photos must be genuine, usable images relevant to the account member. Group and culturally modest photos, including hijab, niqab and traditional clothing, are permitted when otherwise compliant. You must have permission to upload images containing other adults. Images whose primary purpose is text, scenery, advertising, a random object or impersonation may be rejected as unsuitable for a matrimonial profile.'),
      LegalSection('3. Prohibited images',
          'Do not upload nudity, sexual activity, sexually explicit or fetish content, lingerie-focused or sexualized imagery, swimwear or bikini imagery intended or assessed as unsuitable for this matrimonial context, exploitation, violence, hate symbols, illegal content, intimate images shared without consent, images of minors used deceptively, contact advertising, watermarked stolen photos or malicious files.'),
      LegalSection('4. Automated checks',
          'Before publication, the app validates that the file is a decodable image, uses on-device object signals to assess human presence and uses an on-device safety classifier to detect explicit content. Server validation checks that the upload is authorized and accompanied by a valid moderation result. We do not publish model thresholds because doing so would help evasion. Automated systems can be wrong and may change as safety improves.'),
      LegalSection('5. Approval and review',
          'Photos assessed as compliant may publish without advance administrator approval. High-confidence explicit-content results are blocked and may be placed in a restricted moderation queue for authorized review. Members and staff may report or review a previously approved photo when new context or risk appears. We may remove, blur or restrict a photo while investigating.'),
      LegalSection('6. Photo privacy',
          'Moderation approval and visibility are different controls. You can select public, mutual-interest or request-to-view privacy. Access decisions are enforced by signed media access and account permissions, but recipients may still capture what they can view. Do not upload a photo you cannot tolerate an authorized recipient seeing.'),
      LegalSection('7. Decisions and appeals',
          'The app gives a practical reason when possible, such as unsupported image, no person detected or explicit content. Try a different clear image if the result is a quality error. To challenge a moderation decision, email safety@silarah.com with the account email and approximate upload time; do not attach prohibited content to ordinary email.'),
      LegalSection('8. Enforcement',
          'Repeated attempts to upload prohibited content, manipulate scores or bypass upload controls may lead to feature limits, suspension or termination. Apparent child sexual exploitation or other serious unlawful material may be preserved and reported as required by law.'),

Silarah does not appoint a wali or decide whether a person has religious or legal authority for a marriage.'),
      LegalSection('2. Guardian-managed profiles',
          'A parent, sibling or other authorized family representative may create and manage a profile for an adult candidate only with that candidate’s informed permission and accurate information. The profile is disclosed to members as Guardian-managed. The managing account remains responsible for activity and must stop using or delete the profile if authority or consent is withdrawn. Guardian-managed ownership does not itself provide chat-oversight access to another account.'),
      LegalSection('3. Adult member control and consent',
          'The adult profile owner (the “ward” in this Policy) chooses whether to enable guardian mode, supplies guardian details and selects available permissions. A guardian must know they are being linked and use their own authorized account. Do not secretly enrol, monitor or control another adult.'),
      LegalSection('4. Linking and verification',
          'A link may require a matching invitation, contact verification or other security checks. Guardian contact information is not publicly displayed. Silarah may pause or reject a link when identity, authority, consent or account safety cannot be established.'),
      LegalSection('5. Passive and active modes',
          'In passive mode, a guardian may receive read-only access to linked conversations and relevant match context. In active mode, where offered and enabled, a guardian may approve a match or send a message in the linked workflow. Guardian-originated activity is recorded and should be distinguishable; a guardian may not secretly impersonate the member.'),
      LegalSection('6. Privacy of all participants',
          'When guardian chat mirroring is enabled, conversation participants should expect messages in that conversation to be visible to the linked guardian. Guardian access is limited by account permissions and row-level controls. Guardians must not copy, publish or misuse member information and must comply with the Terms and Community Guidelines.'),
      LegalSection('7. Unlinking and access changes',
          'The adult member may disable guardian mode or change permissions in Settings, subject to security checks and any action already completed. Unlinking stops future authorized access but cannot erase copies a guardian lawfully received or actions already recorded. Silarah may unlink or restrict a guardian for misuse or safety risk.'),
      LegalSection('8. Safety and disagreements',
          'Guardian involvement does not replace the adult member’s consent, independent judgment or local legal requirements. Threats, coercive control, forced marriage, harassment or misuse of private messages are prohibited. Use block/report tools and contact safety@silarah.com; contact local emergency or specialist services where anyone is at risk.'),
      LegalSection('9. No legal or religious determination',
