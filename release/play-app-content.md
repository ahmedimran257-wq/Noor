# Google Play App content worksheet

Complete this against the exact release candidate. It records the intended
answers; the Play Console submission itself remains the source of truth.

## User-generated content and safety

## Developer identity alignment

Before submission, compare the verified Play developer profile with the public

displayed developer name, postal address, support email and privacy contact must
refer to the same operator. Record the check in the release ticket; do not add
private identity documents to Git.
