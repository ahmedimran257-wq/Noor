every answer against the exact production build and the current Play Console
wording immediately before submission.

## Handling notes for Console answers

- Mark data as **ephemeral** only when code truly processes it in memory and does
  not persist it. Profile photos, chat, IDs, reports and transaction records are
  not ephemeral.
- On-device ML Kit/TFLite processing alone is not third-party sharing because
  the image stays on the device. The later upload to Supabase is collection.
- A user-initiated translation sends the selected message text to MyMemory;
  declare that service-provider sharing while the feature is active.
- Government-ID collection and matching are not present in this build. The
  optional photo check uses temporary look/smile/blink captures for authorized
  human comparison and deletes them after review and no later than 48 hours.
- The self-service export redacts credentials and confidential third-party or
  anti-abuse material. An assisted privacy route remains available for omitted
  categories and legally required explanations.
- Do not select advertising or marketing purposes for transactional email or
  FCM unless marketing campaigns are actually enabled in the submitted build.
